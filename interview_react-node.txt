You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers.
 Flip all the bits (1->0 and 0->1) and return the result as an unsigned integer.
Example
n=9(10)9(10)=1001(2). 
We're working with 32 bits, so:
000000000000000000000000000001001 = 9(10)
111111111111111111111111111110110 = 4294967286(10)
Return 4294967286.
Output:
int: the unsigned decimal integer result
Input Format
The first line of the input contains q, the number of queries.
Each of the next q lines contain an integer, n, to process.
Constraints
1 <= q <= 100
0 <= n < 2^32
Sample Input 1
2 -->the number of queries- how  many input will be
4 --> inpur //0100->1011
123456
Sample Output 1
4294967291
4294843839

Given a string containing of 0, 1 and ? - a wildcard character, generate all distinct binary strings that can be formed by replacing each wildcard character by either 0 or 1.
Example 1:
Input: 1??0?101
Output: 10000101 10001101 10100101 10101101 11000101 11001101 11100101 11101101
Explanation:There will be 8 such possible strings that can be formed, they are 10000101, 10001101, 
10100101, 10101101, 11000101, 11001101, 11100101 and 11101101.
Example 2:
Input: 10?
Output: 100 101
Explanation: There are 2 such possible strings and they are 100 and 101.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to write a function which takes the given string as input parameter and returns a vector of strings containing all the possible strings that can be formed.
Note : Strings should be printed in lexicographically increasing order.
Expected Time complexity: O(2^n)
Expected Space complexity: O(n*2^n)
Constraints:
1 ≤ length of string ≤ 30
Note: Number of '?' in any string does not exceed 15.



String str="XYZ";
const splitStr = str.split("");
let size = splitStr .length();
let revers=[];
splitStr.forEach((item,index)=>{
    if(index==size){
      revers.push(item)
   }
   index--;
}).join();
