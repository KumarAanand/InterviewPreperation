Mark tasks as complete.
Use React state to store the list of tasks.
Use useState for managing the state and useEffect for managing side effects, such as saving tasks to local storage.
Concepts to demonstrate:

Functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect).
Conditional rendering.
List rendering using .map().
Basic event handling (onClick, onChange).
2. Weather App with API Integration
A weather app that fetches data from a public API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) to display weather information based on a user's location or search input.

Features to include:

Search by city name and display weather details (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
Display a loading spinner while fetching data.
Use useEffect to call the API when the component mounts.
Error handling for invalid or unavailable data.
Concepts to demonstrate:

Fetching data with fetch or axios.
Using useEffect for side effects (API calls).
Conditional rendering (loading states and error handling).
Form handling (search input).
Display dynamic data (weather info) based on state.
3. Simple Blog (CRUD with API Backend)
Create a simple blog app where users can create, edit, delete, and view posts. You can either integrate a backend like JSONPlaceholder (for a mock API) or build a backend with Node.js.

Features to include:

Display a list of blog posts.
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for blog posts.
Use useState to manage the state of posts.
Use useEffect to load posts from an API on component mount.
Use React Router to navigate between pages (list of posts, create new post, etc.).
Concepts to demonstrate:

Routing with React Router.
State management (useState, useEffect).
Form handling (input fields for creating and editing posts).
Working with RESTful APIs (fetching, posting, updating, deleting data).
Conditional rendering (error handling, loading states).
4. E-Commerce Shopping Cart
A mini e-commerce store where users can add products to their cart and view the cart contents.

Features to include:

Display a list of products with "Add to Cart" functionality.
View the cart with a list of selected products and the total price.
Update the quantity of items in the cart.
Remove items from the cart.
Persist the cart data using local storage (optional).
Concepts to demonstrate:

Props drilling for passing data to child components.
State management (useState, useContext for global state management).
Event handling (click to add/remove items).
Conditional rendering (empty cart, cart summary).
Using local storage or a global state (context API) for cart persistence.
5. Movie Search App (with API Integration)
An app that allows users to search for movies using an external API like OMDB (Open Movie Database).

Features to include:

Search for movies by name.
Display a list of movies with basic info (title, year, poster).
Display movie details (e.g., plot, ratings) when clicked.
Loading and error states (e.g., "no results found").
Concepts to demonstrate:

Handling API calls with fetch or axios.
Using state to manage search input, results, and loading/error states.
Dynamic rendering based on fetched data.
Using React Router to navigate to individual movie detail pages.
6. Real-Time Chat Application (WebSocket or Firebase)
A real-time chat app using Firebase, Socket.io, or a similar technology to handle communication.

Features to include:

Real-time messaging between users.
Show a list of users currently online (optional).
Allow users to send and receive messages instantly.
Show notifications when a new message is received.
Concepts to demonstrate:

Real-time communication using WebSockets, Firebase, or any other real-time service.
Use of useState and useEffect for managing messages and updates.
Handling dynamic events like new messages using WebSocket listeners or Firebase listeners.
Conditional rendering for unread messages and notifications.
7. Expense Tracker
A personal finance app that allows users to track their expenses.

Features to include:

Add and categorize expenses (e.g., groceries, entertainment, bills).
View a summary of expenses by category or total spending.
Calculate total expenses.
Use charts or graphs (with a library like Chart.js or Recharts) to visualize spending.
Concepts to demonstrate:

Form handling (input for adding expenses).
State management (useState and useReducer).
Display dynamic data (summary of expenses, charts).
Use of third-party libraries (e.g., Chart.js).
Persist data with local storage or context API.
8. Authentication Flow (Login/Signup)
A simple user authentication flow using a mock API or Firebase.

Features to include:

User login and registration with form validation.
Display authentication errors (invalid credentials).
Redirect to a dashboard or protected route after login.
Option to log out and redirect to the login page.
Concepts to demonstrate:

Handling forms and validation.
Conditional rendering (for displaying login or logout buttons).
React Router for protected routes.
State management (user authentication state).
Managing API requests and handling errors.
9. Kanban Board (Trello-like)
A project management app similar to Trello, with columns and draggable cards.

Features to include:

Create columns and drag and drop cards between columns.
Add, edit, and delete tasks (cards).
Use local storage or backend to persist board data.
Responsive design to view on mobile and desktop.
Concepts to demonstrate:

Drag-and-drop functionality (using libraries like react-dnd or react-beautiful-dnd).
State management (managing the structure of columns and tasks).
Component composition (reusable column and task components).
Handling complex state updates (like moving cards between columns).
10. Quiz Application
A quiz app that presents questions to the user and shows their score after completing the quiz.

Features to include:

Display a series of multiple-choice questions.
Keep track of the user's score.
Show a result screen with the total score and correct answers.
Timer for each question or for the entire quiz.
Concepts to demonstrate:

Conditional rendering (question display, score screen).
State management for score and question index.
Form handling for answer selection.
Timer functionality (using setTimeout or setInterval).
General Skills to Highlight in Your Projects:
State Management: Demonstrating effective use of hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext) to manage state across components.
React Router: Ability to navigate between views/pages using React Router.
API Integration: Fetching data from external APIs and displaying it dynamically.
Performance Optimization: Techniques like lazy loading (React.lazy), memoization (React.memo), and use of useCallback to improve performance.
Testing: Implementing unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
By working on these projects, you can not only showcase your React skills but also demonstrate your ability to build full-fledged, functional applications that would be relevant to real-world work.
